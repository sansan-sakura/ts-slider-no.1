# TypeScript Practice -- image slider --

This is the first project with TypeScript. It is a simple slider which has two button to click and it shows the next image.

## Problems

It was a challenge to use TypeScript as a first time, and create a slider as the first time. So i was confused with index numbers. When to modify an index number to show the next image and when to stop addting a number, so that it shows only photos that are there to display. I used so many console.log to see what is going on in each lines, then finally found out my solution.
In terms of Typescript, I ma not so sure, if I used it correctly, however, I am on a learning path...
